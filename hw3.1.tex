\maketitle

This algorithm would not work, because there is a subtle error: when \( k = i \), \( id[i] \) will change to \( id[j] \), and then we will miss all the other elements who were in the same class as \( i \), since their flag will be the old \( id[i] \) not the new one. To correct this, we would have to store \( id[i] \) as a \emph{flag} variable, and then run the tests with \emph{flag}.
